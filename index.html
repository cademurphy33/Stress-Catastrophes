		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the decades before this catastrophe, Guatemala has had many problems such as the CIA coup, economic problems, and they were in an energy crisis. In 1975 the National Electrification Institute (INDE) made a plan to make a hydroelectric dam in the river basin Chixoy to help solve the energy problem but it would flood land that would affect about 3,445 people living in the many communities in the area. In June 1978 were notified that they would be relocated and given land. The community of Rio Negro didnt accept the proposol by the State for several reasons. The land and houses that they were promised if they were relocated was harsh and not suitable. 800 Maya-Achí inhabited Rio Negro and the surrounding area of the river Chixoy since the Maya Classic period (330 BC to 900 years AD). Rio Negro also had several religious places. The peasants resisted leaving their lands.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Peasant Unity Committee (CUC) which taught literacy and human rights, supported and advised residents of Río Negro in their lawsuits against INDE. In 1979 the Guerrilla Army of the Poor arrived at Río Negro, held meetings with community leaders associated with CUC and spoke of revolution. On March 6, 1980 two residents of Río Negro who were in Pueblo Viejo were accused of stealing beans from the dining rooms of the dam workers. They were chased back to their village by 3 officers. The officers were then rounded up by the villagers and brought to the Church where one officer was hit by a community leader. The officer then opened fire, killing seven villagers. The officers fled and one was injured and drowned crossing the river. That July two villagers asked to bring a written agreement to the dam site were found murdered a few days later and the written documents were lost.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1981, the Guatemalan government began destroying villages as part of the scorched earth campaign, and relocating communities in ‘model villages’ that could be easily controlled and monitored by the army and also provide cheap labor to neighboring towns. The government also created Civil Defense Patrols, made up of armed locals, often forcefully recruited. One such patrol was created in the village of Xococ, near Rio Negro. In February 1982, 74 villagers in Rio Negro were instructed to bring their identification cards to Xococ. When the villagers reached the town they were murdered by the Xococ Patrol. One woman escaped and returned to Rio Negro to warn the other villagers. The men of the village decided to flee and hide in the hills leaving the women and children in the village, under the assumption they would not be harmed. The next month Civil Patrols from Xococ arrived in Rio Negro, under the pretense of guerrilla activity in the area, and massacred the women and children, killing 177. A group of survivors took refuge in the community Los Encuentros. This community was attacked with grenades by the Army on May 14, 1982, killing 79 peasants, during which 15 women were abducted. All the houses were burnt. On September 14, 1982 soldiers and patrols from Xococ village came to this community, proceeding to gather all people in one of the houses. Under the charge of supplying the guerrillas with materials, they fired from outside the house and then they set it on fire. As a result of this action 92 people were killed, including the elderly, children and women.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The remaining people who could escape these massacres fled to the mountains, where, with advice from ESP, lived in groups who were traveling from one side to another to avoid being detected by the Army. After all these slaughters INDE began to fill the reservoir. As a declarant said: "After the slaughter, people left and the place began to fill with water, as simple as that". After the 1983 amnesty, the survivors came down from the mountain. After going through Coban, they dispersed throughout Guatemala.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Rio Negro’s almost 800 Maya-Achí inhabitants, 444 were killed in the massacres between 1980 and 1982. Even more were displaced, tortured, raped, or left starving. The entire area was left in authoritarian control. The villagers were in extreme terror for fear of their lives and their family’s lives. They were also in extreme grief of lost ones and of their lost land as it was their home and had lots of religious significance.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today in Río Negro live a total of twelve families, all in extreme poverty. Moreover, the inhabitants of Xococ still considered as guerrillas to the survivors of Río Negro, while they latter consider the former murderers. In 1998, sixteen years after the Río Negro Massacres. At a second trial in 1999, the three were sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. The 33 communities affected by the construction of the Chixoy Dam entered into negotiations with the Guatemalan government for integral reparations. The reparations package included an unprecedented budget for long-term community development. It was agreed to by President Colom, but he never officially signed and the reparations were not implemented. A case was also taken to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) for integral reparations for the massacres that took place. Representatives from Rio Negro and the victims’ association ADIVIMA met with the IACHR in March 2010 to request that their case of the five massacres at Rio Negro be moved to the Inter-American Court in Costa Rica. ADIVIMA and international partners including GHRC, continue to push for justice for the massacres, and reparations for dam-affected communities. The Chixoy Dam produces 15% of Guatemala’s total electricity production.
